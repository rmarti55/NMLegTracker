Hello,

Someone (possibly you) has requested a password reset for your account.

If this was really you, please click here:

    <%= $reset_url %>

Or, copy this token and paste it into your web browser:

    <%= $token %>

IF YOU DID NOT REQUEST THIS, DON'T PANIC. Someone on the Internet is
being nasty. (This happens, believe it or not). They have not gained
access to your account, nor changed your settings. Simply delete
this notification and carry on. Ed apologizes for wasting your time.
