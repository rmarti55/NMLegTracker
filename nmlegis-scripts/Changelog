  - Status table: for bills that have passed one chamber, but not yet been referred to the other chamber, add a "[no referrals]" note. This gives a clearer indication that the bill still has a ways to go.

* 2025-03-10
  - Show all sponsors and cosponsors for bills, not just the first five.
  - Bug fix: schedule changes were sometimes being lost or delayed.

* 2025-03-08

  - new Half-Passed page, for showing bills passing only one chamber so far.

* 2025-03-04
  - committee pages: vote reports: repeat headings every 15 rows; otherwise the table gets too long and requires scrolling up and down to figure out names.

* 2025-03-03
  - legislator pages: now show daily schedules (committees where they sit, and committee hearings for bills they sponsor and for which they might be called to testify).
  - search: now indexes bill BLURBS! The "AN ACT TO BLAH BLAH" text that is not actually part of the title
  - search: now redirects to committee or legislator when given an abbreviation.

* 2025-02-27

  - tracker pages - collapse hearing schedules. Show only the bills on this tracker, not the entire list. Also show agenda sequence number. Tracker pages are now much more readable.
  - along those lines, in agenda tables, the committee link now goes to that specific calendar instead of just to the page.
  - bill pages - highlight party of dissenting votes. In individual bill pages (the ones showing bill text), in the committee vote record lines, highlight the party of nay votes.
  - committee schedule page - remove House and Senate floor agendas. They're just too unwieldy. Show them in their individual pages instead.
  - bill/legislator/committee update tables - hide under accordion expander. Most people won't care about this.

* 2025-02-22

  - Much better handling of Committee Substitutions. This is a big one. Bill pages now display the most recent committee sub, with links to prior ones (if any). In bill rows, the expected "CS/" is now there.
  - Much better handling of Committee Reports. I now link to the original report, and parse it better.

* 2025-02-20
